#### Technologies

Here is a list of technologies we use:

- **React JS**: Frontend React JS
- **Firebase**: handle APIs in frontend and also use for database.


#### Code Style

- We follow proper naming convention like for folder we are using `camel Case` for files `Pascal Case` and function name should be in `camel Case`.
- We are following Prettier to proper format the code.

##### Rules

- **No `console.log`s in any file**: we are removing `console.log` after develping done.

#### First time setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/svarcoder/Youtube.git
```

After clone install the node modules:
